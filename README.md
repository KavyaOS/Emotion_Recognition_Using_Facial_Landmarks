# Emotion_Recognition_Using_Facial_Landmarks

Facial features extraction was done using dlib's pre trained model.

You may have to install dlib, OpenCV-contrib-python, boost-python modules to run this project.

Downloading any standard dataset for emotion recognistion should work.

Special thanks to "https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/ " tutorial from which I could learn a lot.
